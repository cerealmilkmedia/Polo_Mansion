    "description": "To craft this sweater, cashmere is meticulously combed from goats raised in the mountains of Mongolia, where the high altitude and cold climate result in a fine, soft underfleece. Only the whitest long-staple fibers are used, which ensures perfectly even coloration when dyed, as well as exceptional warmth and incredible softness. After this meticulous sourcing process, they're spun by artisans in a century-old Italian mill and washed using pure water from the Swiss Alps.",
