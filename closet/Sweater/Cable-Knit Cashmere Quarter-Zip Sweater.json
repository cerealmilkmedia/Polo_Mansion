    "description": "To craft this sweater, cashmere is meticulously combed from goats raised in the mountains of Mongolia, where the high altitude and cold climate result in a fine, soft underfleece. Only the best fibers are selected, which ensures perfectly even coloration when dyed, as well as exceptional warmth and incredible softness. After this precise sourcing process, they're spun by artisans in a century-old Italian mill and washed using pure water from the Swiss Alps.",
