    "description": "An American style standard since 1972, the Polo shirt has been imitated but never matched. Over the decades, Ralph Lauren has reimagined his signature style in a wide array of colors and fits, yet all retain the quality and attention to detail of the iconic original. This roomy version features a twill \"3\" patch, nodding to the number typically worn by a polo team's strongest player.",
