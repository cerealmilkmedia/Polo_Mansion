    "description": "An American style standard since 1972, the Polo shirt has been imitated but never matched. Over the decades, Ralph Lauren has reimagined his signature style in a wide array of colors and fits, yet all retain the quality and attention to detail of the iconic original. Updated with an \"RL\" turtleneck, this Polo Bear's outfit is inspired by an iconic photograph of Mr. Lauren that was used in a denim advertising campaign.",
