    "description": "An essential building block of the Ralph Lauren look, our iconic Italian-crafted Polo blazer is the result of time-honored traditions spanning decades of impeccable design. The soft shoulder, which harkens to classic American haberdashery, is achieved through meticulous interior tailoring that trims excess fabric and padding, followed by a unique pressing process. Fine horsehair canvassing combined with an elegant lapel roll and a lower button stance creates an ideal silhouette that can be worn both formally and casually.",
